    "Understanding dispersion is crucial because it helps us grasp the degree of uncertainty, consistency, or variability within the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer: 5. Discuss the role of random sampling in making inferences about populations.\n",
    "Random sampling plays a crucial role in statistical analysis and inferential statistics. It involves selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population in such a way that every individual has an equal chance of being chosen. This approach is foundational for making valid and reliable inferences about the overall population based on the sampled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Random Sampling\n",
    "Representativeness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Ensures that the sample accurately reflects the diversity and characteristics of the population, minimizing bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: Leads to more reliable and generalizable conclusions about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduction of Bias:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Prevents systematic errors that could skew the results.\n",

    "\n",
    "Purpose: Provides a basis for using probability theory to make inferences about the population.\n",

    "Simplification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Makes data collection and analysis more manageable and cost-effective compared to studying the entire population.\n",

    "Example\n",

    "\n",
    "Determine the Sample Size: Decide on the number of individuals to be sampled.\n",

    "Select the Sample Randomly: Use random selection methods (e.g., random number generators) to choose individuals from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect and Analyze Data: Gather data from the sampled individuals and perform statistical analysis.\n",

    "Outliers: Skewness can indicate the presence of outliers. Data transformations or robust statistical methods might be needed to handle skewed data.\n",

    "Example: Logarithmic transformation can help stabilize variance and make skewed data more normally distributed.\n",

    "Statistical Tests:\n",
